# SQL-Project-Analysis

## Project Objective
In this project, I was tasked with analyzing the employee data of a fictional company to gain insights into various aspects of its workforce. The datasets I worked with contained information aboout employees, their departments, salaries, titles, and managerial position. Using queries and data manipulation techniques, I extracted relevant information from the dataset to present meaningful insights capable of supporting decision-making processes within the organization.

In total, I worked on 30 questions for my analysis and also to get famimliar with standard and andvanced level SQL techniques. I have organized these SQL queries by different types of operations. Each query is designed to answer a specific business or technical problem. Feel free to explore the queries and how they can be applied to real-world scenarios
